# Augmented Reality Sports Project

## Overview
This project utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) technology to enhance the experience of indoor sports such as badminton and tennis. By projecting virtual court lines onto the physical surface, players can visualize game boundaries more effectively.

## Features
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays accurate court lines in real-time as players move around the court.
- **Marker Detection**: Scans a specially placed marker on the ground to align the virtual elements correctly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use application designed for both casual players and professional athletes.

## Supported Sports
- **Badminton**
- **Tennis**
- **Other Indoor Sports**: Future updates may include support for additional sports.

## How It Works
1. **Marker Placement**: A designated marker is placed on the playing surface.
2. **Scanning Process**: The application uses a camera to detect the marker and determine its position.
3. **Court Line Projection**: Once detected, the app overlays the corresponding court lines onto the surface, enhancing player awareness of boundaries.

### Step 2: Open the App and Scan
- Launch the app and grant camera access. It will scan for the marker and calibrate the court lines.

### Step 3: Select Outlines for Outer Lines
- Tap the "Outlines" button to display the outer boundaries of the court.

### Step 4: Select Court for Inner Lines
- Tap the "Court" button to show the inner lines, enhancing your court layout understanding.

### Step 5: Enlarge the Court
- Tap the "Large" button to adjust and enlarge the court visualization as needed.

Follow these steps for an interactive AR court experience!
